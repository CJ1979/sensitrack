Additional material to the Article "Reasons and Strategies for Privacy Features in Tracking Systems - A Systematic Literature Review" by Christian Jandl, Christian Reichl, Markus Wagner, Thomas Moser and Sebastian Schlund

RESEARCH METHOD

To  asseses  the  limits  of  privacy  that  are  potentially  violated  by  the  use  of  trackingsystems,  a  systematic  literature  review  was  conducted.   This  method  [44]  has  benefits  ascompared to a narrative style.  It is able to identify the areas covered by existing research orto reveal the gaps as well.  Furthermore it approaches the existing literature from differentperspectives and facilitates the acquisition of new knowledge.  Figure 1 illustrates the processthat has been carried out.

The following research questions are investigated in that study:
•RQ1:What are most frequently named privacy issues in asset- and staff tracking sys-tems?
•RQ2:  Which frameworks exist to evaluate the privacy of users of track and tracingsystems?
•RQ3:  What are the most frequently used strategies to implement privacy features inasset- and staff tracking systems?

SEARCH PROCESS

To  get  a  comprehensive  overview  of  privacy  preserving  methods  supporting  trackingsystems for industrial and health-care environments, we used a number of digital libraries(IEEE  Xplore,  ACM  digital  library,  Springer  Link and  Science  Direct).   All  searcheswere based on title, keywords and abstract.  The search took take place between October2019 and May 2020.  

For all the sources the following search string were used:privacy AND (’asset tracking’ OR ’staff tracking’ OR ’employee tracking’ OR’indoor positioning’ OR ’worker monitoring’ OR ’staff monitoring’ OR ’locationtracking’ OR ’real time location systems’ OR ’traceability’)

We were looking for tracking systems with implemented privacy features,  but a lot of the  found  papers  often  dealt  with  the  topic  in  a  wider  range  such  as  general  guidelines,specific  privacy  issues  without  a  certain  tracking  system  or  privacy  preserving  protocols.Furthermore, many papers on tracking systems were found in which the search terms werepresent, but the topic of privacy was not discussed in detail.  

This explains the actually very high number of excluded papers in table 3.  In addition, many systems were found that use GPS as technology, since this work only deals with indoor tracking systems, these were also excluded.  Since each platform provides different search functions,  the procedure for each database used is now described in detail.

•IEEE  Xplore:  The  first  search  with  the  search  string  led  to  667  found  articles  injournals  and  conference  proceedings.   To  be  more  precise,  the  results  were  filteredaccording to the publication topics.  For example, the topics vehicular ad hoc networks,smartphones, cryptography were discarded.  This search strategy ended in an amountof 459 papers, 10 of which were used in the analysis.

•Science Direct:  here we used the advanced search of the platform was and searchedspecifically for the search terms in title, abstract or author-specified keywords.  It is worth mentioning that only eight logical operators are accepted in the search string.This number of possible operators was fully used with the search string used.  As shownin table 3This led to 97 papers found of which we could use four for our analysis.


•Springer Link:  Here the search string needed some adoption because it gets inter-preted different like on the other platforms.  56 articles were found of which 3 matchedour seach criteria

•ACM Digital LibraryOn this platform it was necessary to sort out all media formatsexcept pdf format.  The customized search string returned 67 results, of which threepapers are included in the analysis.

INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA

This step was necessary to identify all relevant work needed to answer the research ques-tions.  With regard to the research questions, the following inclusion- and exclusion criteria,shown  in  table  2  were  defined.   Peer  reviewed  articles  of  the  following  topics,  publishedbetween Jan 1st 2014 and May 30th 2020 on international conferences and journals, were observerd.

After the first iteration only 14 articles were found.  To ensure that all relevant paperswere found, the references of the found papers were scanned to find further possible publi-cations.  We also checked the conferences and journals where these publications were listedto find additional material.  Furthermore, relevant patents were checked for resulting publi-cations.  All these measures did result in 3 new articles.  We eventually identified 17 papersmatching our specific topic

Data Collection

The data extracted from each article were:A)  The  source  (journal  or  conference)  and  full  reference.   B)  The  author(s)  and  theirinstitution and the country where it is situated.  C) Year of publication D) Classificationof the presented system typ e.g.human or asset-tracking system, and used technology.  E)Classification  of  privacy  issues  and  solutions  (addressing  RQ1  and  RQ2). Data AnalysisThe data analysis were split in two parts.  First the reasons why privacy threads was concerned in the systems (according to RQ1), and the second, which privacy features wereimplemented (according to RQ2).

Reasons for Privacy Features Implementation
The selected articles were read an the reasons why privacy was a part of the project wereextracted into an seperate list.  Afterwards, all arguments were collected and superordinatecategories were created.  This was done to gain insights why privacy was implemented andwhat are possible attack scenarios regarding privacy in an AT-system.  These categories andscenarios are then discussed in that section.
